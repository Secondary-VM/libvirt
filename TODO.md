- Add install script to move secVM template into position
- Create empty ext4 file on primaryVM creation
- Attach/Detatch disk to primaryVM
- Remove hardcoding
	- primaryVM id into secVM xml
	- primaryVM name when adding secVM into priVM cgroup
	- Solution to both would be to add a pointer to priVM into secVM structure
- Figure out why from daemon you calling "create" fails
